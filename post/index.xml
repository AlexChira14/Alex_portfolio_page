      <description>Our goal is to predict whether the credits that our company give are risky, to search the most relevant features that we need to focus on to identify possible defaults, and finally to predict which customer are the most risky.
In this first project, we will get two datasets, one for the customers data and another with the status of the credits. We will create the target variable, data preprocessing, feature engineering and data analysis (where we will distiguish between categorical and numerical variables).</description>

      <description>Our goal is to predict the next 24 hours of energy consumption, on an hourly basis.
To achieve this, we will first carry out an exploration and visualisation of the data. Then, I will provide a theoretical framework for the SARIMA model. To perform this type of model, we first have to make sure that the time series is stationary, which consists of two parts. Once we are able to ensure this, we will identify the main stationarity of the series with the help of the Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Project III: Stock Price Prediction of Tech Companies</title>

      <description>Our aim is to decide between Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google which is the most interesting company to invest in. Once we have chosen the company, we will try to predict what its stock market value will be on the next trading day.
In order to decide which company to invest in, we will make a descriptive analysis of the companies performance over the last year. We will also look at the risk of each company when investing.</description>
